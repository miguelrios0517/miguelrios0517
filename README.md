Hello, nice to meet you! My name is Miguel Rios and I currently work as a freelance web developer. If you have a project in mind you would like to execute, reach out! I love designing/building web apps, from as simple as a landing page to as complex as a comprehensive dashboard application.

I graduated from the University Of Washington Seattle with my bachelor's degree in Human-Centered Design and Engineering. I started as UX designer but quickly transitioned into a developer role. However, my design philosophy and knowledge still apply today. Starting with a user-centered perspective, I am able to better organize my development process and prioritize app components and elements most relevant to the user. The result is a well-built MVP that optimizes for the user experience.

Web skills: HTML, CSS, JS, React

Analytics: Python, Juypter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, other ML libraries
